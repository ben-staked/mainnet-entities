# Staking Ledger Allocations in YAML so we can comment as needed

# This file is a simple "key": "value" where key is the github name and the
# value is the quantity of tokens to assign. The tokens are whole tokens so
# when they're translated in the staking ledger they will be multiplied by 1e9

# Accounts are not self staked and their public keys are defined here.
# Additionally a mapping of `name: delegated_token_quantity` is contained in the
# `delegate_to` section.
